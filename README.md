# Bilby.ai Test Assessment

## Project Description

The task is to create a simple web application. The web application is a low-fi, toy version of a tool like https://prodi.gy that enables humans to create training sets for NLP-based machine learning models. Specifically, the web app should enable the user to apply “labels” to “documents”. Here, both a “labels” and a “documents” are defined to be arbitrary strings. In practice, the “label” will usually describe some feature of the “document”.
